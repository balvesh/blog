Hello! I'm Balvesh Rakkar, a Lead Developer at Rightpoint with around 7 years of experience in Magento. My journey in the world of eCommerce has been a rewarding one, where I've honed my skills in optimizing performance, squashing bugs, and ensuring that every project runs smoothly.

## What I Do

- **Performance Optimization**: Keeping an eye on performance is crucial. I frequently use tools like New Relic to monitor and fine-tune our systems to ensure they are running at their best.

- **Bug Fixing**: No project is perfect, and that's where I come in. I enjoy diving deep into code to identify and resolve bugs that could impact the user experience.

- **Work Planning**: A well-thought-out plan is key to any successful project. I help in drafting workplans that keep our team on track and our clients happy.
